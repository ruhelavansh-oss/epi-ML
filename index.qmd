## Introduction

This project presents a retrospective epidemiologic study of alcohol and cannabis use among postsecondary students using the CPADS 2021-2022 public-use microdata. The objective is to estimate population burden, associational structure, and causal-effect targets under explicit assumptions.

## Project Scope

The scientific workflow combines:

1. Design-based survey inference for prevalence and uncertainty.
2. Regression and model-comparison layers for adjusted association estimates.
3. Causal estimators (g-computation, IPW, AIPW, and matching-based contrasts).
4. eBAC-specific evaluation using measured eBAC variables provided in the wrangled workflow.
5. Semiparametric machine learning sensitivity evaluation (DoubleML random-forest learners).

## Core Estimands

- Weighted heavy-drinking prevalence in the target population.
- Logistic odds ratios for cannabis-exposure association with heavy drinking.
- Risk-difference causal targets: ATE, ATT, ATC, and subgroup contrasts (CATE-style summaries).
- eBAC-domain outcomes (`ebac_tot`, `ebac_legal`) under observed-domain and weighted models.

## Deployment Notes

- Public repository content is restricted to code, sanitized narrative outputs, and website assets.
- PUMF and row-level local outputs are excluded from version control.
- Runtime pathing is environment-configured to avoid machine-specific hardcoded locations.
