## Project Description

This website accompanies the study **Epidemiological Semiparametric Machine Learning: Retrospective Alcohol and Drug Use Cohort Study**. The project evaluates alcohol and cannabis use relationships in CPADS 2021-2022 with design-based and causal-inference methodologies.

## Data and Governance

- The study is performed on de-identified public-use microdata.
- Public outputs are curated to preserve privacy and prevent disclosure of sensitive artifacts.
- Raw source files and private intermediate outputs are retained outside published site content.

## Technical Framework

- **Quarto** for manuscript-style scientific web publishing.
- **R** for data management, statistical estimation, and causal sensitivity evaluation.
- **GitHub Actions** for security checks and reproducible site deployment.
- **Posit Connect Cloud** compatibility through manifest-based publishing.
