\begin{abstract}
\noindent\textbf{Background:}
Alcohol- and cannabis-related harms remain major public health concerns in Canadian student populations. This proposal develops a reproducible epidemiological framework for estimating prevalence, association, and causal contrasts from observational CPADS 2021--2022 microdata while aligning construct definitions with DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 nosology.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Objective:}
To quantify the direction and magnitude of the relationship between past-year cannabis use and past-30-day heavy drinking, with explicit confounding control, semiparametric estimation, and sensitivity analyses suitable for policy and clinical stakeholders.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Study Design:}
Retrospective observational cohort-style analysis of unique respondent-level records from the Canadian Postsecondary Education Alcohol and Drug Use Survey (CPADS) 2021--2022 Public Use Microdata File. Primary analyses combine survey-weighted generalized linear modeling, propensity-score weighting/matching, doubly robust estimators, and semiparametric double machine learning.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Knowledge Translation:}
The project will be released as an open, reproducible computational workflow (Quarto/R Markdown + Git) with full code, environment metadata, and renderable manuscripts. Raw microdata will not be redistributed because the dataset is already publicly available under Government of Canada open data terms.

# Research Proposal

## Background

The Canadian Postsecondary Education Alcohol and Drug Use Survey (CPADS) provides respondent-level data collected between November 2021 and April 2022 [@healthcanada2024_cpads_pumf_data; @healthcanada2025_cpads_technical_notes]. The CPADS Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) enables large-scale observational analysis of alcohol and cannabis use patterns in postsecondary populations.

The present study is motivated by three needs:
1. precise survey-weighted prevalence estimation of heavy drinking;
2. robust confounding-adjusted estimation of cannabis-heavy drinking relationships;
3. transparent and reproducible computational methodology for policy translation.

Diagnostic interpretation will be anchored to official psychiatric and nosological frameworks:
- DSM-5-TR substance-related and addictive disorders (including Alcohol Use Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder) [@apa2022_dsm5tr];
- ICD-11 disorders due to substance use, including disorders due to use of alcohol (6C40) and cannabis (6C41) [@who2022_icd11].

## Objective and Aims

### Primary objective
Estimate the association and model-based causal contrast between cannabis exposure and heavy drinking in CPADS 2021--2022 under explicitly stated assumptions.

### Specific aims
1. Estimate survey-weighted heavy-drinking prevalence and uncertainty.
2. Estimate adjusted association using survey-weighted logistic regression.
3. Estimate causal contrasts (ATE, ATT, ATC, CATE) using propensity and doubly robust methods.
4. Quantify robustness using sensitivity analyses for residual confounding and modeling choices.

### Primary hypothesis
Past-year cannabis use is positively associated with, and under identifying assumptions increases, risk of past-30-day heavy drinking.

## Study Design

### Design type
Retrospective observational cohort-style analysis of individual CPADS respondents (non-randomized treatment assignment).

### Data source
- CPADS 2021--2022 PUMF: [@healthcanada2024_cpads_pumf_data]
- CPADS technical notes/user guidance: [@healthcanada2025_cpads_technical_notes]

### Unit of analysis
Unique respondent-level records (cross-sectional wave analyzed with cohort-style causal estimands).

### Randomization status
There is no experimental randomization. Randomization is approximated analytically through covariate adjustment, propensity weighting, and matching.

## Exposure, Outcome, and Covariates

### Treatment (exposure)
`cannabis_any_use` (binary): past-year cannabis use indicator.

### Outcome
`heavy_drinking_30d` (binary): heavy drinking in past 30 days.

### Core covariates
- age group
- gender
- province/region
- self-rated mental health
- self-rated physical health

### Survey design variable
- `wtpumf` (sampling weight)

## Diagnostic Classification Alignment (DSM-5-TR and ICD-11)

This proposal uses DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 as formal diagnostic frameworks for construct validity and interpretation [@apa2022_dsm5tr; @who2022_icd11].

### Alignment strategy
CPADS variables are treated as epidemiological indicators aligned to diagnostic domains rather than full clinical diagnostic interviews. This distinction is methodological (measurement context), not a challenge to DSM or ICD authority.

| CPADS construct | Operational variable | DSM-5-TR / ICD-11 alignment | Role in study |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alcohol involvement | `alcohol_ever`, `alcohol_past12m` | Substance use domain (AUD-related behavioral indicators) | Exposure/outcome context |
| Heavy alcohol pattern | `heavy_drinking_30d` | Harmful-use/intensity proxy relevant to AUD severity dimensions | Primary outcome |
| Cannabis involvement | `cannabis_any_use` | CUD-related behavioral indicator | Primary treatment |
| Health status modifiers | `mental_health`, `physical_health` | Clinical vulnerability/context variables | Confounding control |

Where needed for coding crosswalk in manuscript text, DSM-5-TR coding examples may include alcohol/cannabis use disorder labels (for example F10.10/F10.99 and F12.10/F12.99 in DSM-linked coding contexts) [@apa2022_dsm5tr].

## Statistical and Computational Analysis Plan

### 1) Descriptive epidemiology
- Survey-weighted prevalence estimates and confidence intervals.
- Demographic stratification by gender, age group, region, and mental health.

### 2) Association modeling
Survey-weighted logistic regression:
\[
\log\left(\frac{P(Y=1\mid X)}{1-P(Y=1\mid X)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2^\top X
\]
where \(Y\) is heavy drinking and \(T\) is cannabis exposure.

Primary association measure:
\[
\mathrm{OR} = \exp(\beta_1)
\]

### 3) Causal estimands
Potential outcomes notation:
\[
\mathrm{ATE}=E[Y(1)-Y(0)], \quad
\mathrm{ATT}=E[Y(1)-Y(0)\mid T=1], \quad
\mathrm{ATC}=E[Y(1)-Y(0)\mid T=0]
\]

### 4) Propensity-score methods
Propensity model:
\[
e(X)=P(T=1\mid X)
\]

ATE inverse-probability weights:
\[
w_i=\frac{T_i}{e(X_i)}+\frac{1-T_i}{1-e(X_i)}
\]

Planned diagnostics:
- weight distribution and trimming;
- covariate balance before/after weighting;
- overlap/positivity checks.

### 5) Matching and subclassification
- nearest-neighbor matching for ATT-oriented contrasts;
- subclassification for ATE-oriented contrasts;
- post-matching balance assessment.

### 6) Doubly robust and semiparametric estimation
- augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW);
- semiparametric double/debiased machine learning (DML) with cross-fitting and orthogonal scores [@chernozhukov2018_dml].

### 7) Class imbalance and model sensitivity
SMOTE-based sensitivity checks for outcome imbalance [@chawla2002_smote], compared against non-resampled models.

### 8) Uncertainty and inference
- bootstrap standard errors for causal estimators;
- robust uncertainty reporting and interval estimation;
- multiplicity-aware interpretation for secondary analyses.

## Assumptions and Identification Conditions

Causal interpretation is conditional on:
1. consistency;
2. conditional exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding given measured covariates);
3. positivity/overlap;
4. correct or sufficiently robust nuisance model specification.

Sensitivity analyses are mandatory because unmeasured confounding may remain.

## Preliminary Computational Feasibility and Signal

Using the current working workflow on CPADS:
- weighted heavy drinking prevalence was approximately 45.8% (95% CI 45.2% to 46.5%);
- adjusted survey-logistic cannabis coefficient corresponded to OR about 5.71;
- IPW ATE estimates were near 0.394 on the risk-difference scale.

These values establish feasibility and motivate a finalized proposal with stronger methodological language and complete reproducibility packaging.

## Knowledge Translation and Open Science Plan

### Reproducibility products
The project repository will include:
- Quarto and R Markdown manuscript sources;
- analysis scripts and workflow orchestration;
- rendered outputs (tables, figures, report artifacts);
- session and package metadata (software stack provenance);
- reproducibility instructions for full rerun.

### Data-sharing policy
The repository will not redistribute CPADS microdata. Instead, it will link to the official open-data source and provide acquisition instructions under Government of Canada licensing terms [@healthcanada2024_cpads_pumf_data].

### Stakeholder-facing outputs
- technical manuscript for peer review;
- concise policy brief with key risk-difference and odds-ratio interpretation;
- transparent methods appendix for auditability.
