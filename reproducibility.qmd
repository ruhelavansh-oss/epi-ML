## Runtime Configuration

The workflow resolves all paths through environment-driven configuration:

- `CPADS_PROJECT_ROOT`
- `CPADS_DATA_DIR`
- `CPADS_RAW_PUMF_FILE`
- `CPADS_OUTPUT_PRIVATE_DIR`
- `CPADS_OUTPUT_PUBLIC_DIR`
- `CPADS_REPORTS_DIR`
- `CPADS_SECRET_KEY`

Project defaults are defined in `config/runtime.yml` and can be overridden locally via `.Renviron` or `.env`.

## Execution Commands

```bash
Rscript scripts/run_modules.R
Rscript scripts/render_site.R
Rscript scripts/security_scan.R
Rscript scripts/check_connect_publish_readiness.R
```

## Publication Boundaries

- Public website content is QMD-based and curated for disclosure safety.
- Private microdata and row-level outputs are excluded from repository tracking.
- Security scanning runs locally and in CI before deployment.

## Deployment Targets

- Primary: GitHub Pages (Actions-based static deploy).
- Fallback: Posit Connect Cloud (manifest-based publish from repository).
- GitHub Pages URL: <https://ruhelavansh-oss.github.io/epi-ML/>
