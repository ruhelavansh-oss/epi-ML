## Runtime Configuration

The workflow resolves all paths through environment-driven configuration:

- `PROJECT_ROOT`
- `DATA_DIR`
- `DATA_FILE`
- `OUTPUT_PRIVATE_DIR`
- `OUTPUT_PUBLIC_DIR`
- `REPORTS_DIR`
- `SECRET_KEY`

Project defaults are defined in `config/runtime.yml` and can be overridden locally via `.Renviron` or `.env`.

## Execution Commands

```bash
Rscript scripts/run_modules.R
Rscript scripts/render_site.R
Rscript scripts/security_scan.R
Rscript scripts/check_connect_publish_readiness.R
```

## Publication Boundaries

- Public website content is QMD-based and curated for disclosure safety.
- Private microdata and row-level outputs are excluded from repository tracking.
- Security scanning runs locally and in CI before deployment.
