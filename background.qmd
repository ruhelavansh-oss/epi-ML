## Design

The study uses retrospective observational survey microdata from data 2021-2022. There is no randomized treatment assignment; therefore, causal interpretations are conditional on identification assumptions and should be interpreted as model-based counterfactual contrasts.

Prospective stratified block-randomization outputs in this project are trial-planning artifacts only. They are not used to re-label or reinterpret data observational estimates.
Within data analyses, bias mitigation follows observational-design methods (matching, weighting, covariate adjustment, overlap diagnostics) rather than experimental assignment.

## Target Variables

::: {.callout-warning}
- **Exposure/Treatment proxy**: survey-weighted cannabis use (`cua`; past-year cannabis-use indicator).
- **Primary outcome**: heavy drinking (`hd30d`; past-30-day heavy-drinking indicator).
- **eBAC outcomes**: `ebac_tot` (continuous) and `ebac_legal` (binary threshold indicator), using measured variables available in the wrangled analytic dataset.
- **Adjustment covariates**: age group, gender, region, self-rated mental health, and self-rated physical health.
- **Gender categories**: analyses use available gender categories (`Female`, `Male`, `Non-binary`) with Female/Male as the primary planned contrast and Non-binary retained where feasible.
- **Sex-at-birth constraint**: this workflow does not include complete sex-at-birth fields. The gender variable (`dvdemq01`) captures gender identity including Non-binary respondents; it is not equivalent to sex assigned at birth.

## Analysis Boundary

The full modeling stack is documented on the Home page. This page is intentionally restricted to design context and identification boundaries so those concepts are not duplicated across Project Info pages.

## Assumptions

::: {.callout-caution}
### Interpretation Boundary

Causal language is conditional on the following identification requirements:

1. **Consistency** of potential outcomes.
2. **Conditional exchangeability** after measured adjustment.
3. **Positivity/overlap** in the observed covariate support.
4. **Adequate specification** of nuisance and outcome models.

All associational and causal outputs should be interpreted within these explicit boundaries.
