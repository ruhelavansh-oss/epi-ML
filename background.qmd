## Design

The study uses retrospective observational survey microdata from CPADS 2021-2022. There is no randomized treatment assignment; therefore, causal interpretations are conditional on identification assumptions and should be interpreted as model-based counterfactual contrasts.

Prospective stratified block-randomization outputs in this project are trial-planning artifacts only. They are not used to re-label or reinterpret CPADS observational estimates.

## Target Variables

::: {.callout-warning}
- **Exposure/Treatment proxy**: `cannabis_any_use` (past-year cannabis use indicator).
- **Primary outcome**: `heavy_drinking_30d` (past-30-day heavy drinking indicator).
- **eBAC outcomes**: `ebac_tot` (continuous) and `ebac_legal` (binary threshold indicator), using measured variables available in the wrangled analytic dataset.
- **Adjustment covariates**: age group, gender, region, self-rated mental health, and self-rated physical health.
- **Gender variable**: self-reported gender available in CPADS analytic data; sex-at-birth is not fully available as a two-step measure in this pipeline.

## Estimation Framework

::: {.callout-tip}
### Regression and Association Layers

- Logistic regression for adjusted odds-ratio estimation.
- Logistic interaction modeling (`cannabis_any_use * gender`) for effect-modification inference.
- Regression model comparison and Wald testing for nested-term evaluation.
- SMOTE-based sensitivity models treated as robustness diagnostics, not as replacements for primary weighted estimates.

### Causal Estimators

- Naive risk-difference contrasts.
- G-computation (model-based standardization).
- Inverse probability weighting (IPW), with trimming rules as implemented in scripts.
- Augmented IPW (AIPW) with stabilized fallback logic where package-level calls are not available.
- Matching/subclassification contrasts and subgroup heterogeneity summaries.

### Semiparametric Learning

::: {.callout-warning}
Primary burden estimates are design-based and weighted where specified, including prevalence and confidence intervals. DoubleML random-forest models provide additional robustness checks for treatment-effect targets in the eBAC track.
:::

## Assumptions

::: {.callout-caution}
### Interpretation Boundary

Causal language is conditional on the following identification requirements:

1. **Consistency** of potential outcomes.
2. **Conditional exchangeability** after measured adjustment.
3. **Positivity/overlap** in the observed covariate support.
4. **Adequate specification** of nuisance and outcome models.

All associational and causal outputs should be interpreted within these explicit boundaries.
