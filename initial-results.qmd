## Scope

This page presents point estimates and concise interpretation only. General workflow definitions and method taxonomy are centralized on the Home page.

## Preliminary Estimates

::: {.callout-note}
### Heavy Drinking Prevalence (Weighted)
**Estimate:** `45.8% (95% CI: 45.2 to 46.5)`  
**Interpretation:** Approximately 46 out of 100 students in the weighted target population are estimated to meet the heavy-drinking criterion in the prior 30 days.

::: {.callout-note}
### Cannabis Effect (Logistic OR)
**Estimate:** `5.71 (95% CI: 5.38 to 6.07)`  
**Interpretation:** After model adjustment, the odds of heavy drinking are estimated to be 5.71 times higher among those exposed to cannabis versus those unexposed.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
### ATE (IPW)
**Estimate:** `0.394 (95% CI: 0.383 to 0.404)`  
**Interpretation:** Under the potential-outcomes assumptions, the modeled average absolute risk difference in heavy drinking between exposed and unexposed regimes is 0.394 (39.4 percentage points).

## eBAC Interpretation Meaning

::: {.callout-tip}
- `ebac_tot` quantifies continuous estimated blood alcohol concentration available in the measured eBAC domain.
- `ebac_legal` indicates whether observed eBAC exceeds the legal-limit threshold.
- eBAC treatment-effect estimates are domain-specific and should not be generalized beyond the observed eBAC analytic subset without additional assumptions.
:::

## Reliability and Robustness

::: {.callout-tip}
- Confidence intervals quantify statistical precision.
- Agreement across naive, adjusted, IPW, and AIPW estimates supports directional robustness.
- SMOTE and DoubleML outputs are interpreted as sensitivity diagnostics for model stability, not as primary survey-design estimands.
- Prospective block-randomization schedules are design blueprints for future studies, not features of the CPADS observational sample.
